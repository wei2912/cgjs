# Lesson 1: “Hello, World!”: Exercises

This week, there will be no coding exercises. We need you to complete two courses for week 4:

1. [Codecademy’s course on HTML & CSS](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web). You will only need to complete the “HTML Basics” section.
2. [Mozilla Developer Network’s Getting started with CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started). You will only need to complete up till “8. Color”.

If you have knowledge of HTML and CSS, just give a quick skim through these courses to ensure that you know everything you will need.

You're required to complete these exercises by the 3rd lesson (23/7/15).
